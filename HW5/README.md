# SSW 567 - HW05-Static-Code-Analysis


The objective of this assignment is to apply the techniques from the lecture to static testing of your Triangles program.    Specifically:

You will run a static code analyzer on your code, e.g. Pylint, identify and fix any problems reported by the static code analyzer;
You will run a code coverage tool on your code, e.g. Coverage.py, and extend your test cases to demonstrate at least 80% code coverage;
In this assignment, you will need to download and install the tools that you will need for static code analysis and code coverage.  You will then run those tools locally on your laptop to get the results. 

Any changes that you make to your programs should be pushed up to GitHub.
