# HW05-567

Applying the principles from the lecture to static testing of your Triangles program is the goal of this homework. Specifically:

You will run a static code analyzer on your code, such as Pylint, find any issues it finds, and repair them; You will extend your test cases to show at least 80% code coverage and run a code coverage tool, such as Coverage.py, on your code; You must download and install the necessary tools for code coverage and static code analysis for this assignment. To obtain the findings, you will then execute those tools locally on your laptop.

You should push any modifications you make to your scripts to GitHub.
